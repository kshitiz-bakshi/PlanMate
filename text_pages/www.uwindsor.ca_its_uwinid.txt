It appears before the "@" sign in your primary University of Windsor email address (UWinID@uwindsor.ca). Most University computer systems use your full UWinID@uwindsor.ca as the username. A few systems, however, require just your UWin ID to be entered as the username. *Note: some UWindsor email addresses also have an alias, usually in the form firstname.lastname@uwindsor.ca, as a second option to send and receive email.
